# Optimize 3D bin packing problem with PSO and GRASP metaheuristic

We present the problem of distribution of boxes (items) in containers (bins) which is based on the "3D bin packing problem" problem. In the present work we study 2 metaheuristics PSO and GRASP studied in class and 1 heuristic related to packing boxes within a container called EMS (Empty Maximal Spaces). We also include results and conclusions from the
work done.
